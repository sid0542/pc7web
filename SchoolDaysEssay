I would like to share about my school days, golden days of my life. school days are the period of your life when you were at school. school days are the happiest Days Of Our Lives. school days were better than today because we were free from all the responsibilities. The Golden period of a child’s life, School life gives ever green moments and memories to many of us. It is the place where we get our first learning, friends, teacher, homework, punishment and much more things that make the best part of our life. Apart from subject we learn social and moral values in our school which is very crucial for our lives. We had unlimited enjoyment and entertainment during our school days. Most memorable moments like school picnics, inter school function, sports day and the get together parties are unforgettable. Doesn’t matter, whether we make our participation or not we will enjoy those moments incredibly. I had some school friends. we used to play in the lunch break after fininshing the lunch. In the lunch, we used to share our lunch with each other. We also used to play some puzzle games in the gap between the classes. But now when we recall those instants it seems they are far better than the current situation. and....I also want to talk about my school teacher. In everyone’s life we have our favorite teacher who played a major role. They are our role models and greater inspiration. I also have a role model, my math teacher. I admire him the most. He was a robust man, tall and a handsome person. From his face, one could make out that how intelligent he is. he had also cleared the IIT JAM exam. In the midst of my class 12th, he got a job in income tax department and he left us. i will never forget him. I will forever remember him as my favourite teacher for the way he taught me and many more things.
lastly, may god makes everyone's school days as awesome days as mine.
